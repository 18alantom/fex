**A command-line file explorer.**

---

`fex` is a command-line file explorer inspired by
[Vim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>),
[exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), built with
quick exploration and navigation in mind.

By using Vim-like keybindings, `fex` ends up being a near-effortless
tool to zip around a file system:

- `j`, `k` to move to the pervious and next item
- `h`, `l` to move up or drop down a directory
- `/` to search for items
- `:` to run commands on the selected item

## Installation

The most convenient way is by running the following bash one-liner:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/18alantom/fex/master/install.sh && bash install.sh
```

If you are a Nix user, just run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Run the program immediately:
nix run github:18alantom/fex

# Enter a temporary shell with `fex` available:
nix shell github:18alantom/fex
```

Getting `fex` running involves:

1. Installing the `fex` executable.
2. Setting up the shell integration.

To get install the `fex` executable follow this section. For the shell
integration go to the [Setup](#setup) section.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ðŸš§ Installation using package managers (Homebrew, apt, etc) will be added.

### Using `install.sh`

You can use [`install.sh`](https://github.com/18alantom/fex/blob/master/install.sh) script to [download](https://github.com/18alantom/fex/releases) and setup fex.

Run the following bash one-liner to setup fex:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/18alantom/fex/master/install.sh && bash install.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> To uninstall fex:
>
> 1. Remove the `$HOME/.fex` directory.
> 2. Delete the lines pertaining to fex from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

### From Source

To install fex from source, you will need version `zig` version 0.13.0 installed. You can get it from [here](https://ziglang.org/download/).

Once you had done that, compile the executable by using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the fex repository
git clone https://github.com/18alantom/fex && cd fex
```

#### macOS

```bash
# Compile the fex executable for your system
zig build-exe -O ReleaseSafe main.zig

# Move the executable to usr bin
mv main /usr/local/bin/fex
```

#### Linux

```bash
# To be able to open files, you will need xdg-open from xdg-utils
sudo apt install xdg-utils
```

```bash
# Compile the fex executable for your system
zig build-exe -O ReleaseSafe main.zig -lc

# Move the executable to usr bin
mv main /usr/bin/fex
```

## Setup

To use `fex` to its full extent it needs to be set up as a shell widget. This
allows fex to:

- Be invoked using a key binding.
- Execute shell commands. For example `cd` to quit and change directory.

These are shell specific so you will need to set it up separately depending on
the shell you use.

> [!NOTE]
>
> ðŸš§ bash and fish shell support will be added.

### Zsh Setup

To setup the Zsh widget for fex, first copy the file `shell/.fex.zsh` to your
home directory. Then copy the following lines into your `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Source .fex.zsh if it's present
[ -f ~/.fex.zsh ] && source ~/.fex.zsh

# Bind CTRL-F to invoke fex (key binds can be custom)
bindkey '^f' fex-widget
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can change which key is used to invoke `fex` by using the Zsh `bindkey` command.
> For example if you use Zsh vi mode, you can use `bindkey -a 'f' fex-widget` to
> invoke `fex` using the `'f'` key when in command mode.
>
> Reference:
>
> - ZLE manpage (`man zshzle`), the ZLE BUILTINS section.
> - [Binding Keys and handling keymaps](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide04.html#l93)

### `fex` Default Command

After you have set up fex for your shell, you can `FEX_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to change
what flags `fex` is invoked using. For example:

```bash
# Sets time displayed to access time and hides icons
export FEX_DEFAULT_COMMAND="fex --time-type accessed --no-icons"
```

## Config

You can configure `fex` by passing it args.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Config is picked up from the `FEX_DEFAULT_COMMAND` envvar and CLI args
> passed when calling `fex`. CLI args take precedence.

### Display Config

Changes values displayed in an item line.

| arg                 | description                                                                                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--[no-]icons`      | Show or hide icons. Note: icons need a [patched font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) to work. |
| `--[no-]size`       | Show or hide item sizes                                                                                 |
| `--[no-]time`       | Show or hide time                                                                                       |

| `--[no-]link`       | Show or hide link target                                                                                |
| `--[no-]user`       | Show or hide user name                                                                                  |
| `--[no-]group`      | Show or hide group name                                                                                 |

### Search Config

This changes search behavior.

| arg              | description                                  |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| --regular-search | Uses regular search, instead of fuzzy search |
| --match-case     | Match search query case, instead of ignoring |

> [!TIP]
>
> `fex` uses smart case matching by default i.e case is ignored until you
> enter an upper case character.

### Other Args

| arg         | description                        |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `--help`    | Prints the help message and quits. |
| `--version` | Prints the version and quits.      |

## Controls

`fex` has three modes:

- **Default**: used to navigate around a file system and enter one of the other modes.
- **Search**: toggled with `/`, used to accept a query and find matching items in expanded directories.
- **Command**: toggled with `:`, used to accept a shell command that is executed on `enter`. `fex` needs to be setup as a shell widget for this to work, see [Setup](#setup).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Keys mentioned in angle-brackets such as `<enter>` show which key has to be
> pressed. Keys mentioned without such as `cd` are sequences that have to be
> typed.

## Platform Support

`fex` should ideally compile and run on all macOS and Linux targets supported
by Zig. Some features such as opening fs items work only on macOS for now.

Portions of `fex` code is platform specific and Windows compatibility has not
been accounted for. This may be added in later.

| arch | macOS   | Linux            | Windows          |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| arm  | works   | does not compile | does not compile |
| x86  | works\* | works            | does not compile |

Currently fex only has shell integration for Zsh. Fish and Bash integrations will
be added.

_works\*: uses stat instead of lstat for macOS x86 so links may not be shown._
